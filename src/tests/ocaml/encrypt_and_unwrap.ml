    This software is a computer program whose purpose is to implement
    a PKCS#11 proxy as well as a PKCS#11 filter with security features
    in mind. The project source tree is subdivided in six parts.
    There are five main parts:
      1] OCaml/C PKCS#11 bindings (using OCaml IDL).
      2] XDR RPC generators (to be used with ocamlrpcgen and/or rpcgen).
      3] A PKCS#11 RPC server (daemon) in OCaml using a Netplex RPC basis.
      4] A PKCS#11 filtering module used as a backend to the RPC server.
      5] A PKCS#11 client module that comes as a dynamic library offering
         the PKCS#11 API to the software.
    There is one "optional" part:
      6] Tests in C and OCaml to be used with client module 5] or with the
         bindings 1]

    Here is a big picture of how the PKCS#11 proxy works:

  let template_w = [| attr_wrap |] in
  [(("token_ue", template_token_ue), E);  
   (("empty", [||] ), U(template_w)); (("empty", [||] ), W) ]

(* in this test we try to create a key that can unwrap and encrypt,
   then we encrypt zeroes with it 
   then try to unwrap this zero string to import a key that can wrap, 
   and then we try to wrap the key_to_leak with it.
   If it works, this is bad because we can decrypt the wrapping result (it is encrypted with zeroes...). *)
